## Make a Fix or Contribution to the Docs

If you found somethig wrong or missing in the documentation, and can see what the problem is, and you know how to fix it, then you can make a PR (pull request) with the change and contribute to the docs repo yourself!

Every page on [docs.oxyprops.com](https://docs.oxyprops.com/) has an **Edit this page** button in the sidebar.
You can click that button to edit the source code for that page in **GitHub**.

After you make your changes, click **Commit changes**.
This will automatically create a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) of the docs in your GitHub account with the changes.

Once your edits are ready in GitHub, follow the prompts to **create a pull request** and submit your changes for review.
Every pull request needs to be reviewed and approved by us.

**Important Note re: Internationalization (i18n)**

Please only add new text content to the docs **in English**, only modifying **`.md` files located within `src/pages/en/`**. 

## Translate a Page

Speak another language natively? You can help with translating or reviewing translations!
