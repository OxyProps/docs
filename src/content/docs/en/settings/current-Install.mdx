o-props will display number of currently available [Groups](#groups), [Packs](#packs), [Props](#props).

### Groups

Groups contain related Packs. For example, the `Typography` group contains all the Packs related to fonts and typography. You will find all groups in the left sidebar of the `Customizer`.

### Packs	

Packs usually contain all Props having the same purpose. For example, the `Fluid Sizes` pack contains the whole range of Props defining fluid sizes. After picking a group in the `Customizer`, packs available for this group are visible at the top of the page in the Pack Selector.

### Props	
Props consist of `[key: value]` pairs. The key is what you will use in the builder or in your CSS, by calling it with the `var()` function. The value is the actual value of the CSS variable. You can customize part of the key (the `Suffix`), and values for each prop in the `Customizer`.

### Classes	
For each Pack, you are offered several Utility Classes options to generate. For exampe, the `Sizes` pack can generate classes for setting `margins`, `paddings`, `gaps`, `insets`, etc. When a Utility Classes Option is active, the corresponding classes are generated only for the Pack active Props.
