## Figma Tokens

o-props makes it extremely easy to export your tokens to Figma when you use [Tokens Studio](https://tokens.studio/). Tokens Studio for Figma is a Figma plugin allowing you to integrate Tokens into your Figma designs.

You can use either the Free or Pro version of Tokens Studio with o-props tokens. To install the plugin, go to the [Tokens Studio website](https://docs.tokens.studio/getting-started#installing-the-plugin) and follow the instructions.

There are 2 options to export your tokens to Tokens Studio:

### Figma Tokens

The first option is to export your tokens to Figma Tokens. This is the default option and the one we recommend for one time usage. It will create a new Figma file with all your tokens. You can then import this file in Tokens Studio for Figma.

1. Click on the **Download Figma Tokens** button in your o-props dashboard.

  height="506"
  formats={["avif", "webp"]}
  alt="Screenshot of the o-props dashbord highlighting the Download Figma Tokens button."
/>

2. In Figma, open the plugins tab and launch **Tokens Studio for Figma**.

  width="900"
  height="506"
  formats={["avif", "webp"]}

/>
3. If this is your first use in this design, choose **New Empty File**.

  formats={["avif", "webp"]}

/>

4. If you wish, you can safely delete the **Global** Set that was created by default. To do so, right click on it and choose delete.

5. To import your tokens, click **Tools** at the bottom left. Then click **Load from file/folder or preset** and select the JSON file you downloaded.

6. Congrats! Your Props (tokens) are now available for your design in Figma!

Learn more about using your props on the [Tokens Studio website](https://docs.tokens.studio/tokens/applying-tokens).

### Figma Tokens Sync

The second option is to export your tokens to Figma Tokens Sync. This option is also available with the free version of Tokens Studio! It will create a new Figma file with all your tokens and will keep it in sync with your o-props tokens. This is the option we recommend if you want to keep your tokens in sync with your o-props tokens.

:::note
The Figma Tokens Sync feature is read only. The sync is one way, from your website to figma. You can’t edit your o-props tokens from Figma.
:::

1. Click on the **Copy the Sync URL** button in your o-props dashboard to copy the URL to your clipboard.
2. In Figma, open the plugins tab and launch **Tokens Studio for Figma**.

## Design Tokens

The [Design Tokens Community Group's](https://www.w3.org/community/design-tokens/) goal is to provide standards upon which products and design tools can rely for sharing stylistic pieces of a design system at scale.

Thay have released the [Second Editors’ Draft](https://second-editors-draft.tr.designtokens.org/format/) for their Design Tokens Format Module. As stated in the document, this “is not a W3C Standard nor is it on the W3C Standards Track”.

However, we think it is a great starting point for a standard format for design tokens, and are offering to export your props in this format.



## Style Dictionary

Transform your design tokens using [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/). Style Dictionary is a build system that allows you to define styles in a way for any platform or language to consume.

Download your tokens in the Style Dictionary format to use them in your build system.

```sh
npm install style-dictionary
```

Tokens Studio also offers a transform package for Style Dictionary.

```sh
npm install @tokens-studio/sd-transforms
```

- [Tokens Studio Configurator](https://configurator.tokens.studio/)
