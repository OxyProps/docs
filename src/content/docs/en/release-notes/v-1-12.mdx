  # update o-props from the cli
  wp plugin update oxyprops
```

## CLI

WP-CLI is the command-line interface for WordPress. It provides a command-line interface for many actions you would perform in the WordPress admin.

In this release, o-props integrates with WP CLI and adds 2 commands to WP CLI to easily activate and deactivate the plugin license.

### License Activation

```sh
  # activate your license from the cli
  wp oxyprops activate YOUR-LICENSE-KEY me@domain.com
```
- `YOUR-LICENSE-KEY` is your o-props license key that can be found in your [user account](https://oxyprops.com/my-account/)
- `me@domain.com` is the email address associated with your o-props license.
