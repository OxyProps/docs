OxyProps goal is to help you build accessible websites. In addition to accessibility built in all CSS Variables and utility classes when possible, we also provide you with a set of specific utility classes that you can use to help include all of your website visitors.

## Screen Readers

### Screen Reader Only

The `.o-sr-only` utility class is used to hide content from all users except screen readers. This is useful for content that is only relevant to screen reader users, such as skip links.

```html title="Utility Class"
o-sr-only
```

If you wonder how this works, here is the CSS code:

```css title="The exact rule for o-sr-only"
.o-sr-only {
  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  padding: 0;
  margin: -1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
  white-space: nowrap;
  border-width: 0;
}
```

### Not Screen Reader Only (Cancels sr-only)

The `.o-not-sr-only` utility class is used to cancel the `.o-sr-only` utility class. This is useful for content that is only relevant to screen reader users, such as skip links.

```html title="Utility Class"
o-not-sr-only
```

If you wonder how this works, here is the CSS code:

```css title="The exact rule for o-not-sr-only"
.o-not-sr-only {
  position: static;
  width: auto;
  height: auto;
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  overflow: visible;
  clip: auto;
  white-space: normal;
}
```
