The light/dark toggle element is a UI component that allows users to switch between a light and dark color scheme on your website. The toggle is usually placed in a prominent position on the page, such as in the header or navigation menu, and when clicked, it switches the color scheme of the page.

    <Fragment slot="bricks">
        <ContentImage coverImage="/images/brx-light-dark-toggle-element.webp" caption="An oversized view of the Light / Dark Toggle element." aspectRatio="16:9" />

        Settings:
        * **Icon Color**:  
        The color of the toggle button. Use a logical color like <ClipboardCopy value="var(--o-links)">`--o-links`</ClipboardCopy> to have it responsive to light and dark modes.
        * **Icon Color Hover**:  
        The color of the toggle button on mouse hover. Use a logical color like <ClipboardCopy value="var(--o-links-hover)">`--o-links-hover`</ClipboardCopy> to have it responsive to light and dark modes.
        * **Size**:  
        The size of the toggle button. You can use any valid size. Defaults to <ClipboardCopy value="var(--o-size-3)">`--o-size-3`</ClipboardCopy> which is equivalent to 1rem.
        * **Size on touchscreens**:  
        It is useful to have a bigger toggle on touch screens because it makes it easier for users to interact with the toggle using their fingers, which have larger touch points than a mouse cursor. This is why this setting allows to define a specific size for touch screens. You can use any valid size. Defaults to <ClipboardCopy value="var(--o-size-8)">`--o-size-8`</ClipboardCopy> which is equivalent to 3rem.

## Usage

To use the light/dark toggle element, simply drag and drop it into your page. You can then customize the element's settings to suit your needs.

By default, OxyProps makes your site responsive to your WebSite visitor system color scheme preference. If your visitor prefers a light color scheme, your site will be displayed in light mode. If your visitor prefers a dark color scheme, your site will be displayed in dark mode. With the Light / Dark Toggle element, your visitor can force your site to be displayed in light mode or dark mode.

### Choice persistence

The light/dark toggle element uses the [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) API to store the user's choice. This means that the user's choice will be remembered even if they close the browser or tab and return to your site at a later time. localStorage is perfectly safe to use for this purpose, as it is not accessible to third-party scripts and is not sent to the server.

### Custom CSS

You can take advantage of the light/dark toggle in your custom CSS to further customize the appearance and behavior of your WebSite.

Create custom CSS rules following this pattern:

```css title="Light/Dark in your custom CSS"
[color-scheme="light"] .my-element {
    /* CSS rules for light mode */
}

[color-scheme="dark"] .my-element {
    /* CSS rules for dark mode */
}
```

## Benefits

The use of a light/dark toggle can provide several benefits for users. For example, some users may prefer a darker color scheme, especially when using a website or application in low-light conditions, such as at night or in a dimly lit room. A darker color scheme can also help reduce eye strain and make text easier to read in certain situations.

On the other hand, some users may prefer a lighter color scheme, especially if they have visual impairments or other accessibility needs that make it difficult to read text on a dark background.

In addition to improving accessibility and user preferences, a light/dark toggle can also enhance the visual design of a website or application, as it provides an additional design element and can help convey a sense of personality or brand identity.
