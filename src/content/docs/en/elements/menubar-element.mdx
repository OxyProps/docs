## Accessibility Features
The OxyProps Menubar custom element includes the following accessibility features:

- Menu items that trigger navigation move focus to the target page title. When a menu item is activated that changes the content on the page without triggering a page load, the focus position after the content load significantly affects efficiency for keyboard and assistive technology users. To address this, this custom element moves focus to the beginning of the new content, which is a level one heading with content that matches the name of the activated menu item.
- To help communicate that the arrow keys are available for directional navigation within the menubar and its submenus, a border is added to the menubar container when focus is within the menubar.
- To help users locate the menu item that loads the currently displayed page, visual indicators of the path to that menu item are added to the menu items in the path. The parent menubar item in the path has an extra thick (4 pixel) bottom border. If the current page menu item is nested within a deeper submenu, the parent submenu item in the path has an extra thick (4 pixel) left side border. Finally, the menu item that loads the currently displayed page is styled with an extra thick border on the left side.
- To support operating system high contrast settings, the focused element has a thicker border and less padding. When an element receives focus, its border changes from 0 to --o-border-size-2 and padding is reduced by --o-border-size-2. When an element loses focus, its border changes from --o-border-size-2 to 0 and padding is increased by --o-border-size-2.
- To ensure the arrow icons used to indicate the expanded or collapsed state have sufficient contrast with the background when high contrast settings invert colors, they are synchronized with the text content's color. If specific colors were used instead, they would remain the same in high contrast mode and could lead to insufficient contrast or even make the arrows invisible if the color matched the high contrast mode background.

## Keyboard Support
The OxyProps Menubar custom element also provides keyboard support for users who prefer to navigate with the keyboard:
