## What is OxyProps?

OxyProps is a powerful plugin that revolutionizes your WordPress design workflow by integrating modern CSS custom properties and productivity features directly into your page builder.

## OxyProps or BricksProps?

Two names, one plugin. OxyProps was first developped for Oxygen Builder, and therefore named OxyProps. When it was later made compatible with Bricks, sur users were annoyed by the name, so to bring their smile, the plugin renames itself in WordPress based on the page builder used. It also loads the appropriate CSS and Javascript files. So, if you use Oxygen Builder, you'll see OxyProps in your WordPress admin, and if you use Bricks, you'll see BricksProps, but it is the same plugin.

## Key Features

- **Powerful CSS Framework** ‚Äî Create beautiful and consistent designs with OxyProps‚Äô modern CSS custom properties and utility classes.
- **Streamlined Workflow** ‚Äî Save time and effort with OxyProps‚Äô smart context menus that make it easy to add props and classes to your elements.
- **Customizable Elements** ‚Äî Build your site faster and with more flexibility using OxyProps‚Äô library of custom elements and structure builder.

## Supported page builders

When you install OxyProps on your WordPress site, the plugin's stylesheets are loaded, making the OxyProps CSS properties and utility classes available for any site builder that accepts custom classes and CSS properties.

However, OxyProps was particularly designed for and supports Oxygen Builder and Bricks Builder. When you use OxyProps with one of these supported page builders, you gain access to builder enhancements that can speed up your workflow.
