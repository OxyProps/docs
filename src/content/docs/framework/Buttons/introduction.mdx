## Buttons or links ?

A button is a user interface element that is used to trigger an action, such as submitting a form or navigating to a new page. It is typically represented as a rectangular or rounded rectangle shape that can be clicked or tapped. Buttons can be created using HTML and CSS or through programming languages such as JavaScript.

On the other hand, a link styled as a button is a hyperlink that is designed to look like a button. It can be created by applying CSS styles to a standard hyperlink, such as changing the background color, border, and font size. When clicked, a link styled as a button can also trigger an action, such as opening a new page or submitting a form.

The main difference between a button and a link styled as a button is their intended use. Buttons are best used for actions that change the state of an application, such as submitting a form, saving data, or deleting content. Links styled as buttons, on the other hand, are best used for actions that navigate to a different page or location, such as going to a new section of a website or opening a new window.

In general, if the user is performing an action that changes the state of an application, a button is the appropriate choice. If the user is navigating to a different page or location, a link styled as a button may be a better choice.

## The base button

This is the base class to use on each button. It sets all properties and their defaults.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; column-gap:5rem;row-gap:1rem; width:100%; justify-content: center;">
	<a href="#the-base-button" class="o-btn">
		<span>button</span>
	</a>
	<a href="#the-base-button" class="o-btn o-hover">
		<span>hover state</span>
	</a>
</div>

```html title="The base button class"
